Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

watch the first 93 seconds of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsjsLwYRW8o

write a function "pyramid" which produces the numbers shown in the video
the function accepts a parameter defining how many number rows to produce
the function prints out the numbers of each row.

in the main program, call the function with 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 as an argument
run the program with shift+f10 (or click on the green arrow)

add a more general function pyramid2
this function accepts as a second parameter a list with the numbers of
the pyramid's topmost row

in the main program, call pyramid2 with 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 as the first argument
and a list of numbers of your choice as the second argument.
try out different lists as the second argument.

replace the zeros with your own code

When your program is complete, push it to your github repository.
Then send this Teams message to your teacher: <filename> done
Thereafter go on with the next file.
