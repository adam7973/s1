"""
First read /misc/SQL.docx and do what it says.

In this program we define a class. Very elegantly, at the same time this creates a sql database table with the same structure.
This is called ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping).
Just to get us going we also create some test data. We need to do this only once.

Run the program.
Read all the comments. You will not understand all of it. That's ok. Some things you will understand later on.
But when using a foreign library, often it's good enough to just make it work without understanding all the details.

This object acts as a central source of connections to a particular database, providing both a factory as well as a holding space called a connection pool for these database connections. The engine is typically a global object created just once for a particular database server, and is configured using a URL string which will describe how it should connect to the database host or backend.
