Exercise "Cars" (with a little help):

As always, read the whole exercise description carefully before your start to solve the exercise.

Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

replace the zeros with your own code

define a function that prints a car's motor sound (for example "roooaar")

in the main program:
define variables which represent the number of wheels and the maximum speed of 2 different cars
print out these properties of both cars
then call the motor sound function

run the program with shift+f10 (or click on the green arrow)

if you get stuck, ask google, the other pupils or the teacher (in this order).
if you are still stuck, open S0047_cars_solution.py and compare it with your solution

Compare your program to the teacher's solution in S0047_cars_solution.py

When your program is complete, push it to your github repository.
Then send this Teams message to your teacher: <filename> done
Thereafter go on with the next file.
