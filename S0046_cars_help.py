Exercise "Cars" (with a little help):

As always, read the whole exercise description carefully before you begin to solve the exercise.

Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

Replace the zeros in the program code with your own code.

Define a function that prints a car's motor sound (for example "roooaar")

In the main program:
    Define variables which represent the number of wheels and the maximum speed of 2 different cars
    Print out these properties of both cars
    Then call the motor sound function

If you get stuck, ask google, the other pupils or the teacher (in this order).
If you are still stuck, open S0047_cars_solution.py and compare it with your solution

When your program is complete, push it to your github repository.
Then send this Teams message to your teacher: <filename> done
Thereafter go on with the next file.

def drive_car():
    print(0)  # print a sound

0  # define maximum speed for car1
0  # define number of wheels for car2
0  # define maximum speed for car2

0  # print out the properties of car2
