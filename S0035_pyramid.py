Write a function "pyramid" which produces the numbers shown in the video.
The function has a parameter defining how many number rows to produce.
The function prints out the numbers of each row and also their sum.

In the main program, call the function with 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 as an argument.

Add a more general function pyramid2.
This function has as a second parameter a list with the numbers of
the pyramid's topmost row.

In the main program, call pyramid2 with 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 as the first argument
and a list of numbers of your choice as the second argument.
Try out different lists as the second argument.

If you have no idea how to begin, open S0036_pyramid_help.py and start from there

When your program is complete, push it to your github repository.
Then send this Teams message to your teacher: <filename> done
Thereafter go on with the next file.
